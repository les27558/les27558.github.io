	<p> Labradoodles are a bundle of love. They are some of the sweetest dogs, and they are so playful. They come in many colors and fur types and it is often difficult to determine either of these traits when they are born. My labradoodle, Pennie, is 7 years old. When she was born, she was the color of a penny (copper), but now she is white. As she aged, her fur changed as well. Labradoodles are also very loyal dogs, and they love the water. Because they are a mix between a Labrador retriever and a Poodle, they have benefits of both species. One of their best attributes is that they are hypoallergenic. This means that they do not produce dander which often causes people to be allergic to many species of dogs. Fortunately, labradoodles, especially 3rd and 4th generation ones, do not shed or induce allergies. There are many wonderful types of dogs, but I believe that every dog lover should own a labradoodle at some point.
